              </br>
              <p>I've made improvements to our internal development guidlines by including a change process methodology/source for packaging developments in line with best practice, and developed a SITS Jargon Buster Glossary index to align broader understanding within the business for our use of specialist terminoligies within the Student and Teaching Solutions Team.</p>

              <li class="bullet">SITS Improvement Programme - User Access Management Workstream; project initiative derived from the governments reinforcement of GDPR. The User Access & Data Management workstream focused on streamlining processes to ensure access levels to the server side API (eVision) used for the core student record system(SITS) was enabled for only those deemed necessary – rather than the universal access to the system customers were having when user accounts were set up by application services. Within this project I've collaborated with the Business Analysis Team to help run workshops and presentations for the business in aid of requirements gathering</li>
              <li class="bullet">SITS Improvement Programme - Compliance workstream; Remediating a list of defects and deficiencies from the Quick Applicant Setup/Quick Student Set Up (QAS/QSS) screen in SITS to improve user experience and streamline process; preventing data corruption. I also took the lead for the further remedation of errors and bugs on the Change of Circumstances Form as part of Student Course Enrolment within the student portal (eVision) for the Student Administration Team </li>

Implementing solutions to deliver change with the Technical Coordinator for technical/service delivery; including the development of a hash key(SHA512) encryption algorithm for SITS. I also helped to coordinate the overall architecture by measuring out the key components of the current interface, comparing this to the proposed set up. This was implemented through mapping out the system interface using UML on Microsoft Visio. As part of the finance project I was also responsible to deliver the before Go-Live presentation to the Application Services Support Team which looked at pointing out the overall architecture of the components and expectations for support to remediate any finance related tickets for future support</li>
              <li class="bullet">Student Integration Enhancement (for Inplace: Medical System) Project. This project focused on reducing the need for regular changes/adjustments for both Nursing and Medicine faculties. I took the lead on this project by using the Stutalk component(SITS) to ensure necessary adjustments identified by the business were implemented on the feed using student data</li>
              <li class="bullet">Graduate Access and Data Retention Project for TARGET Connect - Ensuring the revised business rules were implemented to allow graduates to stay connected with the Careers & Employability service(Target Connect), and allow the business to maintain graduate contact details. Thus making sure the organisation adheres to regulatory body (Higher Education Standards Authority) compliance on graduate outcomes; in which greatly impacts on King’ funding. Within this project I worked with the technical coordinator, collaborated with the Team/key stakeholder to understand business requirements and queried the oracle database using SQL to implement the latest updates to the feed </li>
